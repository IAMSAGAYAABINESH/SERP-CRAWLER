SERP CRAWLER is a web app that crawls the Google search engine for YouTube channels and videos that are associated with the website `openinapp.co`

The script uses the following tech stack:
- `SerpApi` - library to perform the search,
- `Youtube API` - to retrieve additional information about the videos and channels,
- `Streamlit` - library to create the web app and
- `Pandas` - library to display in a table format and export as a `CSV` file

# How to run

1. Download and open the `serp_crawler.py` file.
2. Run the web app using `streamlit run serp_crawler.py` in the terminal.
